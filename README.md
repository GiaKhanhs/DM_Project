## 2. The project we are working on
The project investigates depression in Vietnamese teenagers aged 15-25 using modern data mining methods, highlighting the need for culturally sensitive early detection strategies to reduce mental health issues.

## 3. Goal
- Use machine learning models to accurately predict depression levels among Vietnamese students.
- Tests a range of complex machine learning model approaches to identify the most successful ones.
- Increase the endurance and effectiveness of these classification models by including more potent algorithms.
- Apply data mining techniques to real-world datasets to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical application.
- Empower healthcare practitioners to make more informed clinical decisions and enhance the mental health of Vietnamese students through early detection and intervention.

# REASON

## 1. Motivation
Depression awareness in Vietnam has increased due to the Internet, but the public's willingness to seek screenings remains low. Self-assessment programs like "15minutes4me" offer hope, but they often rely on predetermined symptoms, overlooking the complex interplay between living environment and stress. This data mining project aims to predict depression levels among Vietnamese students aged 15 to 25 by investigating environmental factors and pressures. Building on prior research, the study uses a classification model and analytic techniques to provide a more nuanced understanding of depression among Vietnamese students.

## 2. Idea
Using machine learning model built on top of classification algorithms, to improve prediction accuracy in various sectors, particularly in measuring depression levels among Vietnamese students. Advanced algorithms like Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors are used to manage large datasets, identify patterns, and make accurate predictions.

## 3. Roadmap
- [X] Data collecting
- [X] Data pre-processing
- [ ] Build model to classify
- [ ] Deploy AI Chatbot based on the result
- [ ] More to come...

# METHODOLOGY (based on theory class)

## 1. Ask a question
This study focuses on predicting depression levels among Vietnamese students using data mining techniques. It investigates the accuracy of machine learning algorithms and their practical implications for early detection and intervention, aiming to improve students' well-being and academic performance.

## 2. Data gathering
The research used a systematic approach to gather data on stress and pressure among Vietnamese students. A Google Form survey was created based on various studies and conversations with university specialists. The survey identified five main causes of stress: employment, studies, self, family, and love. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression risk. The survey was distributed to a diverse group of Vietnamese students, ensuring confidentiality and anonymity. The data collected was evaluated for quality and completeness, aiming to improve knowledge and early detection of depression among Vietnamese students.

# RESULT

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The study analyzed data from 1,500 Vietnamese students, with 739 being female and 761 being male. It revealed that females are more prone to severe depression and have a higher risk of self-harm. Family and work-related stressors were significant contributors to depression among female students. Physical activity was associated with lower levels of depression, and students whose parents spoiled were more prone to develop depression later in life. Academic stress was a major concern for high school and first-year college students, while graduates and fourth-year college students were more concerned with employment and finances. The LGBT community also experienced significant stress due to familial and personal concerns. Workplace stress was a major problem, particularly among females. Academic stress, school bullying, parental expectations, instructor partiality, and peer pressure were also significant contributors. Romantic relationships were a major stressor for Vietnamese students, contributing to anxiety and emotional illnesses. Family-related stress was a major concern, with high parental expectations, mistaken caring, and financial issues.
